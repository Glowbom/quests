Tearing off his mask, he turned around and looked at Jessica. \n\n 'Don't you want to hug your father, huh?' - He smiled tiredly.  \n\n In a few seconds, you saw hugs, tears, screams, laughter and some strange sounds. You're confused. Later everything became clear. Mason explained that he had a conflict with Jessica's father, and when he began to threaten the children, Mason staged the death. Mason didn't expect that the children will take the actions to catch the criminals. They almost spoiled everything by involving you. And, of course, Mason didn't expect Steven to be so crazy. Steven was ready to kill his own daughter. This is insane! Steven wouldn't be able to do that anyways. Right before you showed up, Mason got rid of Steven's personal bodyguard and discharged all the guns. \n\n 'You got involved in this story completely by accident.' - Mason said. - 'Despite the circumstances, you reached the end. I didn't know who you are and whether I can trust you or not. Now I know I can trust you. Let me give you the code from my safe. Please open it and bring what is inside.' \n\n You went upstairs, found the safe and opened it easily. Inside was a box of fortune cookies. The old man obviously lost his mind putting it in the safe. All of this happened because of cookies! That's crazy!\n\nThere were exactly eight cookies. One for each guest. You brought it down. The old man asks everyone to take the cookies. Everyone looked at him as if he was insane, but they didn't say a word. Let's try cookies!",

	Mason lived three more days and died from heart attack. Jessica left America for Poland. By the way, you probably already guessed that Phillip didn't send her to the rats.

You have become a successful entrepreneur and an exemplary family man. \n You lived sixty more years.
